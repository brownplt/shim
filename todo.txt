- Make on/to-particle work simply
  - No option return for to-particle, always send
  - Convert to/from json automatically where needed
  - Can add more complicated interfaces later
- Instead of string-dict, consolidate information about cores
  into their own datatype
  - name
  - access code
  - shim?
- Can represent use of stream without specific core in mind as
  separate version of datatype.
- Add a polling per x seconds for digital and analog inputs.
- Change AnalogInputTrigger/ait- to a better name, like AnalogCondition
  (or if we need digital conditions for polling, something more general).
